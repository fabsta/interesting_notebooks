This is surprising, as there is ongoing demand for techniques that can be used to explore, analyse and process time series data, the recent [Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting) competition being one example.\n\nPut simply, SSA decomposes a time series into a set of summable components that are grouped together and interpreted as *trend*, *periodicity* and *noise*. SSA emphasises **separability** of the underlying components, and can readily separate periodicities that occur on different time scales, even in very noisy time series data. The original time series is recovered by summing together all of its components.\n\nThus, SSA can be used to analyse and reconstruct a time series with or without different components as desired. For example, you could apply SSA to:\n* construct a smoothed version of a time series using a small subset of its components; \n* investigate a time series' periodic components to understand the underlying processes that generated the time series;\n* reconstruct the original time series without its periodic components;\n* remove all trend and periodic components from the series, leaving just the 'noise', which may be meaningful in and of itself...\n\nand so on and so forth. Unlike the commonly used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method, SSA makes no assumptions about the nature of the time series, and has just a single adjustable (and easily interpretable) parameter. Further, the base algorithm requires little more than a few lines of `numpy` linear algebra to implement, so you can easily roll your own bespoke SSA implementation if you desire.\n\n## The Purpose of This Kernel\nI intend this kernel to not only introduce and demonstrate the SSA method, but also present its theory and Python implementation. I will present theory and its corresponding code in tandem, bridging the gap between mathematical underpinning and practical algorithmic implementation. While R and Python packages for SSA are available (e.g. [Rssa](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rssa) and [pySSA](https://github.com/aj-cloete/pySSA)), I feel there is more to be gained when the inner workings of a given statistical/analytical technique are understood, instead of relying on a few subroutines from a package.\n\nSSA will be applied to mock time series data to demonstrate its key abilities, illustrate where it excels and falls down, and document potential pitfalls along the way. SSA will then be applied to a real-world time series taken from the dataset, [MotionSense Dataset : Smartphone Sensor Data](https://www.kaggle.com/malekzadeh/motionsense-dataset). This will not be an extensive analysis of the MotionSense dataset, but will instead highlight the ability of SSA to extract underlying periodicities in a noisy, complex time series.\n\nOverall, I hope that these elementary studies of the SSA technique will provide a solid foundation for others to successfully apply SSA to real-world time series data.\n\n## Outline\nIn [Section 1](#Section1), I will define a simple, illustrative toy time series that consists of trend, periodic and noise elements. This time series will be used to demonstrate the workings of the SSA method over the next several sections.\n\n[Section 2](#Section2) introduces the SSA method and translates its formal steps into a practical Python implementation. As we go, I will apply SSA to our toy time series, and intermediate results will be plotted and discussed. At the heart of this section is the acclaimed singular value decomposition. \n\n[Section 3](#Section3) focuses on the notion of separability in SSA, and how it is quantified. Once again, the formal mathematics will be translated into Python, and applied to the toy time series.\n\n[Section 4](#Section4) will bring together the code developed in Sections 2 and 3, creating a simple Python SSA class that will be used in the rest of the kernel (and future kernels).\n\n[Section 5](#Section5) investigates the effect of the window length parameter on the decomposition of the toy time series. \n\n[Section 6](#Section6) applies SSA to real-world time series data from the [MotionSense](https://www.kaggle.com/malekzadeh/motionsense-dataset) dataset. I also propose a hypothetical use for SSA with this dataset. \n\n[Section 7](#Section7) contains a few concluding words.\n\n## Contents\n[1. A Toy Time Series](#Section1) <br>\n[2.

Introducing the SSA Method<a name=\"Section2\"></a>\nThe notation in this section will mostly follow that used in the book, [*Analysis of Time Series Structure: SSA and Related Techniques*](https://www.crcpress.com/Analysis-of-Time-Series-Structure-SSA-and-Related-Techniques/Golyandina-Nekrutkin-Zhigljavsky/p/book/9781584881940) by N. Golyandina, V. Nekrutkin and A. Zhigljavsky—an excellent reference containing more proofs and details about SSA than you could possibly ever need to know. Here, we'll go a step further and develop a Python implementation for SSA. For consistency between the mathematical notation and the code, all matrix and summation indexing with begin at 0 instead of 1.\n\n## 2.1 From Time Series to Trajectory Matrix<a name=\"Section2.1\"></a> \nThe first step of SSA is to map the time series $F$ to a sequence of multi-dimensional lagged vectors. Let an integer $L$ be the **window length**, $2 \\le L \\le N/2$. We form a 'window', given by the subseries $\\{f_i, \\ f_{i+1}, \\ldots , \\ f_{i+L-1}\\}$, for  $i=0,\\ldots,N-L$. We slide this window along the time series, forming a column vector, $X_i$, for each subseries. That is, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\nX_0 & = (f_0, \\ f_1, \\ f_2,  \\ldots, \\ f_{L-1} )^{\\text{T}} \\\\\nX_1 & = (f_1, \\ f_2, \\ f_3,  \\ldots, \\ f_L )^{\\text{T}} \\\\\nX_2 & = (f_2, \\ f_3, \\ f_4,  \\ldots, \\ f_{L+1} )^{\\text{T}} \\\\\nX_3 & = (f_3, \\ f_4, \\ f_5,  \\ldots, \\ f_{L+2} )^{\\text{T}} \\\\\n& \\quad \\quad \\quad  \\vdots \\\\\nX_{N-L} & = (f_{N-L}, \\ f_{N-L+1}, \\ f_{N-L+2}, \\ \\ldots, \\ f_{N-1} )^{\\text{T}}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThese column vectors form the $L$-*trajectory matrix*, $\\mathbf{X}$, of the time series (hereafter just *trajectory matrix*):\n\n$$\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nf_0 & f_1 & f_2 & f_3 &\\ldots & f_{N-L} \\\\ \nf_1 & f_2 & f_3 & f_4 &\\ldots & f_{N-L+1} \\\\\nf_2 & f_3 & f_4 & f_5 &\\ldots & f_{N-L+2} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nf_{L-1} & f_{L} & f_{L+1} & f_{L+2} & \\ldots & f_{N-1} \\\\ \n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nFrom writing out the matrix above, it is clear that the elements of the *anti-diagonals* (that is, the diagonals running from bottom-left to top-right) are equal. This type of matrix is known as a ***Hankel*** matrix.\n\nFor our toy time series, I'll set the window length to 70, and defer discussion on how to select an appropriate window length.

The collection $\\{U_i, \\sigma_i, V_i\\}$ will be denoted the $i$th ***eigentriple*** of the SVD.\n\nTo build a picture of what all of this means, let's inspect the $\\mathbf{U}$, $\\mathbf{V}$ and $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ matrices in turn. \n\n### 2.2.1 The $\\mathbf{U}$ Matrix<a name=\"Section2.2.1\"></a>\n$\\mathbf{U}$ is an $L \\times L$ matrix whose columns are orthonormal, that is\n$$\n    U_i \\cdot U_j = \\left\\{\n  \\begin{array}{lr}\n    1 \\ & i = j \\\\\n    0 \\ & i \\ne j\n  \\end{array}\n\\right.\n$$\nThis means that $\\mathbf{UU}^{\\text{T}} = \\mathbf{U}^{\\text{T}}\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{1}$, making $\\mathbf{U}$ a unitary matrix. \n\nTo elucidate the role that $\\mathbf{U}$ plays in the expansion for $\\mathbf{X}$ above, let $Z_i = \\sigma_i V_i$ be a column vector, so that\n$$\\mathbf{X} = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} U_i Z_i^{\\text{T}}$$\nand each $L$-lagged column vector, $X_j$, is then given by\n$$X_j = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}z_{j,i}U_i$$\nwhere $z_{j,i}$ is the $j$th component of the vector $Z_i$. The expression for $X_j$ suggests that $\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_0,  \n \\ldots, U_{d-1} \\}$ is a basis set spanning the *column space* of the trajectory matrix, and $z_{j,i}$ is the $i$th coefficient of the lagged vector $X_j$ represented in the basis $\\mathcal{U}$. **In other words, the columns of the $\\mathbf{U}$ matrix form an orthonormal basis set that describes the time subseries $\\left\\{ f_i, \\ldots, f_{i+L-1}\\right\\}_{i=0}^{N-L}$ in the columns of the trajectory matrix.**  \n\n### 2.2.2 The $\\mathbf{V}$ Matrix<a name=\"Section2.2.2\"></a>\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{V}$—appearing (by convention) as its transpose in the expression for the SVD of $\\mathbf{X}$—is a $K \\times K$ matrix with orthonormal columns, which, like the $\\mathbf{U}$ matrix, makes it unitary.\n\nTo interpret the columns of $\\mathbf{V}$ in the SVD of the trajectory matrix, we first note that for any appropriately shaped matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, $\\left(\\mathbf{AB}\\right)^{\\text{T}} = \\mathbf{B}^{\\text{T}}\\mathbf{A}^{\\text{T}}$. Taking the transpose of $\\mathbf{X}$, we therefore have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{X}^{\\text{T}} & = \\mathbf{V \\Sigma}^{\\text{T}}\\mathbf{U}^{\\text{T}} \\\\\n                      & = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}V_i Y_i^{\\text{T}}\n\\end{align*}\nwhere we have set $Y_i = \\sigma_i U_i$. Then,\n$$X^{(\\text{T})}_j = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}y_{j,i}V_i$$ \nwhere $X^{(\\text{T})}_j$ is the $j$th column of $\\mathbf{X}^{\\text{T}}$, and $y_{j,i}$ is the $j$th component of the vector $Y_i$. This expression suggests that the $\\mathcal{V} = \\{V_0, \\ldots, V_{d-1}\\}$ is a basis set spanning the column space of $\\mathbf{X}^{\\text{T}}$, and $y_{j,i}$ is the $i$th coefficient of the lagged vector $X^{(\\text{T})}_j$ represented in the basis $\\mathcal{V}$. Equivalently, $\\mathcal{V}$ is a basis set spanning the *row space* of $\\mathbf{X}$. **That is, the columns of the $\\mathbf{V}$ matrix form an orthonormal basis set that describe the time subseries $\\{ f_i, \\ldots, f_{i+N-L}\\}_{i=0}^{L-1}$ in the rows of the trajectory matrix.**\n\n\n### 2.2.3 The $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ Matrix<a name=\"Section2.2.3\"></a>\nThe $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ matrix is an $L \\times K$ rectangular diagonal matrix containing the **singular values** of $\\mathbf{X}$. The singular values are ordered from largest to smallest, i.e. $\\sigma_0 \\ge \\sigma_1 \\ge \\ldots \\ge \\sigma_{L-1} \\ge 0$. **We can interpret $\\sigma_i$ as a scaling factor that determines the relative importance of the eigentriple $(U_i, \\sigma_i, V_i)$ in the expansion $\\mathbf{X} = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\\sigma_i U_i V_i^{\\text{T}}$.**\n\nThe *Frobenius norm* of $\\mathbf{X}$, $\\lvert\\lvert \\mathbf{X} \\rvert\\rvert_{\\text{F}}$, is given by\n$$\\lvert\\lvert \\mathbf{X} \\rvert\\rvert_{\\text{F}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=0}^{L-1}\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\lvert x_{j,k}\\rvert^2}$$\nwhere $x_{j,k}$ denotes the element in the $j$th row and $k$th column of $\\mathbf{X}$. \n\nLet's turn our attention to the elementary matrices $\\mathbf{X}_i = \\sigma_i U_i V_i^{\\text{T}}$. Now, for an outer product such as $U_i V_i^{\\text{T}}$, we have  $\\lvert \\lvert U_i V_i^{\\text{T}} \\rvert \\rvert_{\\text{F}} = \\lvert \\lvert U_i \\rvert \\rvert_{\\text{F}} \\lvert \\lvert V_i \\rvert \\rvert_{\\text{F}}$, which is simply equal to 1 due to $U_i$ and $V_i$ being normalised. From this result, it is then clear that $\\lvert\\lvert \\mathbf{X}_i \\rvert\\rvert_{\\text{F}} = \\sigma_i$. It also turns out that \n$$\\lvert\\lvert \\mathbf{X} \\rvert\\rvert_{\\text{F}}^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\sigma_i^2$$\ni.e. **the squared Frobenius norm of the trajectory matrix is equal to the sum of the squared singular values. This suggests that we can take the ratio $\\sigma_i^2 / \\lvert\\lvert \\mathbf{X} \\rvert\\rvert_{\\text{F}}^2$ as a measure of the contribution that the elementary matrix $\\mathbf{X}_i$ makes in the expansion of the trajectory matrix.**\n\nFurther, if we right-multiply the original SVD of $\\mathbf{X}$ by $\\mathbf{X}^{\\text{T}}$:\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\mathbf{XX}^{\\text{T}} & = \\mathbf{U\\Sigma V}^{\\text{T}}\\mathbf{X}^{\\text{T}} \\\\\n               & = \\mathbf{U\\Sigma V}^{\\text{T}} \\mathbf{V \\Sigma}^{\\text{T}}\\mathbf{U}^{\\text{T}} \\\\\n               & = \\mathbf{U\\Sigma} \\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{\\text{T}}\\mathbf{U}^{\\text{T}}\n\\end{align*}\nLetting the square diagonal matrix $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2 = \\mathbf{\\Sigma \\Sigma}^{\\text{T}}$, and multiplying on the right by $\\mathbf{U}$, gives\n$$(\\mathbf{XX}^{\\text{T}})\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2$$\nwhich—given that $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2$ is a diagonal matrix with elements $\\sigma_i^2$—demonstrates that the columns of $\\mathbf{U}$ are eigenvectors of the matrix $\\mathbf{XX}^{\\text{T}}$, with eigenvalues $\\{\\sigma_0^2, \\ldots , \\sigma_{L-1}^2\\}$. Following a similar argument, multiplying $\\mathbf{X}$ on the left by $\\mathbf{X}^{\\text{T}}$ shows that the columns of $\\mathbf{V}$ are eigenvectors of the matrix $\\mathbf{X}^{\\text{T}}\\mathbf{X}$, also with eigenvalues $\\{\\sigma_0^2, \\ldots , \\sigma_{L-1}^2\\}$.\n\n\n### 2.2.4 The Rank of the Trajectory Matrix<a name=\"Section2.2.4\"></a>\nWe are now equipped to talk about the *rank*, $d$, of the trajectory matrix. The columns of the trajectory matrix are a sequence of $L$-lagged vectors, which span the *trajectory space* of the time series. This space will be at most $L$-dimensional; however, if the columns in $\\mathbf{X}$ are linearly dependent, then the trajectory space will have $d < L$ dimensions. This manifests as one or more zero singular values in $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$. **The rank of $\\mathbf{X}$ is the maximum value of $i$ such that $\\sigma_i > 0$. Put another way, $d = \\text{rank}\\{\\mathbf{X}\\}$ can be regarded as the instrinsic dimensionality of the time series' trajectory space.**\n\n(Note: for noisy real-world time series data, the trajectory space is likely to have $d = L$ dimensions.)\n\nIt is important to note that each elementary matrix $\\mathbf{X}_i$ has a rank of 1, and that the matrix \n$$\\mathbf{X}^{(r)} = \\sum_{i=0}^{r} \\mathbf{X}_i$$\nfor $r < d$, is the best rank-$r$ approximation to the trajectory matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, such that $\\lvert\\lvert \\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{X}^{(r)}\\rvert\\rvert_F$ is minimised. **That is, we can sum the first $r$ elementary matrices to obtain an optimal, lower-dimensional approximation of $\\mathbf{X}$**.\n\n### 2.2.5 Putting it all Together<a name=\"Section2.2.5\"></a>\nLet's quickly recap everything so far: we have mapped a time series $F = \\{f_0, \\ldots, f_{N-1}\\}$ to a collection of multi-dimensional lagged vectors, $X_i = (f_i, f_{i+1}, \\ldots, f_{i+L-1})^{\\text{T}}, i = 0, \\ldots, N-L$, which together comprise the columns of the trajectory matrix $\\mathbf{X}$. We then decomposed this matrix with an SVD; in doing so, we found two orthonormal basis sets, $\\mathcal{U}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$, which span the column- and row-space, respectively, of the trajectory matrix. The SVD of $\\mathbf{X}$ can be written as\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\mathbf{X} & = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\\sigma_i U_i V_i^{\\text{T}} \\\\\n               & \\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\\mathbf{X}_i\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\mathbf{X}_i$ is the $i$th elementary matrix of $\\mathbf{X}$, determined by the eigentriple  $\\{U_i, \\sigma_i, V_i\\}$. The $i$th singular value, $\\sigma_i$, determines the relative contribution of $\\mathbf{X}_i$ in the expansion of $\\mathbf{X}$ above. The integer $d \\le L$ is the intrinsic dimensionality of the time series' trajectory space, and we may choose to obtain a lower-dimensional approximation of $\\mathbf{X}$ by summing only the first $r < d$ elementary matrices.\n\nMuch of what we've covered so far is general to the SVD of *any* matrix, not just the trajectory matrix of a time series. From now on, we are going to focus on reconstructing the components of a time series from its elementary matrices. In practice, the steps involved are quite simple.\n\nEnough chat—let's decompose the trajectory matrix and form its elementary matrices:"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"c9e6ec3b-0d0a-4f5d-bc38-eab28428ca53","_uuid":"8b64ba1e302404659c9a1b4d9d2ba16ac0a236de","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"d = np.linalg.matrix_rank(X) # The intrinsic dimensionality of the trajectory space.\n\n# For those interested in how to code up an SVD calculation, Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77\n# has you covered: http://www.aip.de/groups/soe/local/numres/bookfpdf/f2-6.pdf\n# Thankfully, we'll leave the actual SVD calculation to NumPy.\nU, Sigma, V = np.linalg.svd(X)\nV = V.T # Note: the SVD routine returns V^T, not V, so I'll tranpose it back here.

For example, the \"breaks\" in the plot above suggest that $\\mathbf{X}_2$ and $\\mathbf{X}_3$, and $\\mathbf{X}_4$ and $\\mathbf{X}_5$, should be grouped together. \n\nIt is important to note that the elementary matrices represent an optimal (although possibly non-unique) separation of components in trajectory space: by definition, the rows and columns of one elementary matrix are orthogonal to the rows and columns of the other elementary matrices. However, this separation may not coincide with what we would consider a useful, interpretable 'component' of the time series. In fact, there are restrictions on the types of time series components that are exactly separable under this formalism.\n\n## 2.3 Reconstructing the Time Series<a name=\"Section2.3\"></a>\nSo far, we have mapped a time series $F$ to a series of $L$-lagged vectors, forming the *trajectory matrix* of $F$. We then decomposed this matrix with a singular-value decomposition, and constructed a set of *elementary matrices* which comprise the trajectory matrix. We then gave a bit of a hand-waving explanation to classify these elementary matrices as *trend*, *periodicity* and *noise*. \n\nIn a perfect world, all the components of a time series $F = \\sum_j F^{(j)}$ would be separable, and we would have grouped the the resulting elementary matrices $\\mathbf{X}_i$ appropriately, such that\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{X} &  = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{S}}\\mathbf{X}_k + \\sum_{l \\in \\mathcal{T}}\\mathbf{X}_l + \\ldots \\\\\n             &  = \\sum_j \\mathbf{X}^{(j)}\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ are disjoint (i.e. non-overlapping) sets of indices, and $\\mathbf{X}^{(j)}$ is the trajectory matrix of the time series component $F^{(j)}$. In this case, each $\\mathbf{X}^{(j)}$ would have a Hankel structure like the original trajectory matrix, and construction of each $F^{(j)}$ would be simple. However, in this imperfect real world, no component trajectory matrices will have equal values on their anti-diagonals. Therefore, we seek a process to transform an elementary matrix to a Hankel matrix, and then into a time series.\n\nTo extract a time series from the elementary matrices, we'll employ ***diagonal averaging***, which defines the values of the reconstructed time series $\\tilde{F}^{(j)}$ as averages of the corresponding anti-diagonals of the matrices $\\mathbf{X}^{(j)}$. Formally, this is represented by introducing the *Hankelisation* operator, $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}$, that acts on the $L \\times K$ matrix $\\mathbf{X}^{(j)}$ to give a Hankel matrix $\\mathbf{\\tilde{X}}^{(j)}$; that is, \n$$\\mathbf{\\tilde{X}}^{(j)} = \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\mathbf{X}^{(j)}$$ \nThe element $\\tilde{x}_{m,n}$ in $\\mathbf{\\tilde{X}}^{(j)}$, for $s = m+n$, is given by\n$$\n\\tilde{x}_{m,n} = \\left\\{\n  \\begin{array}{lr}\n    \\frac{1}{s+1}\\sum_{l=0}^{s} x_{l, s-l} & \\ 0 \\le s \\le L-1 \\\\\n    \\frac{1}{L-1}\\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} x_{l, s-l} & \\ L \\le s \\le K-1 \\\\\n    \\frac{1}{K+L-s-1}\\sum_{l=s-K+1}^{L} x_{l, s-l} & \\ K \\le s \\le K+L-2 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right.\n$$\n\nAt first glance, the above looks like an impenetrable soup of matrix indices. However, all it is doing is calculating the given $\\tilde{x}_{m,n}$ by averaging the rest of the elements of the anti-diagonal wherein $\\tilde{x}_{m,n}$ belongs. The number of anti-diagonal elements to sum depends on the location of $m$ and $n$ in the matrix, and hence the index soup. **In practice, we don't need the full Hankel matrix $\\mathbf{\\tilde{X}}^{(j)}$, and can cut straight to the construction of the time series $\\tilde{F}^{(j)}$. However, I've included the definition of $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\mathbf{X}^{(j)}$ above to complete the mathematical exposition of SSA.**\n\nIt is important to note that $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}$ is a linear operator, i.e.  $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}) = \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\mathbf{A} + \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\mathbf{B}$. Then, for a trajectory matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, \n\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\mathbf{X} & = \\hat{\\mathcal{H}} \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\mathbf{X}_i \\right) \\\\\n                            &  = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\hat{\\mathcal{H}} \\mathbf{X}_i \\\\\n                            &  \\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}_i}\n\\end{align*} \nAs $\\mathbf{X}$ is already a Hankel matrix, then by definition $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{X}$. Therefore, the trajectory matrix can be expressed in terms of its Hankelised elementary matrices:\n$$\\mathbf{X} = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\tilde{\\mathbf{X}_i}$$\nAs a time series is uniquely determined from a Hankel matrix, the expression above also defines the time series $F$ as a sum of its components $\\tilde{F}_i$. It is up to us to group these components together, and classify them as trend, periodicity or noise, and then we're free to decide how we use them. \n\nFor fun, I've implemented a Hankelisation procedure below.

This is fine for a short and simple time series, however, for longer and more complicated time series, we seek a method that quantifies whether a reconstructed component $\\tilde{F}_i$ can be considered separate from another component $\\tilde{F}_j$, so we don't need to make grouping decisions by visually inspecting each $\\tilde{F}_i$.\n\nFor two reconstructed time series, $\\tilde{F}_i$ and $\\tilde{F}_j$, of length $N$, and a window length $L$, we define the *weighted inner product*, $(\\tilde{F}_i, \\tilde{F}_j)_w$ as:\n$$(\\tilde{F}_i, \\tilde{F}_j)_w = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} w_k \\tilde{f}_{i,k} \\tilde{f}_{j,k}$$\nwhere $\\tilde{f}_{i,k}$ and $\\tilde{f}_{j,k}$ are the $k$th values of $\\tilde{F}_i$ and $\\tilde{F}_j$, respectively, and $w_k$ is given by\n$$\nw_{k} = \\left\\{\n  \\begin{array}{lr}\n    k+1 & \\ 0 \\le k \\le L-1 \\\\\n    L & \\ L \\le k \\le K-1 \\\\\n    N - k & \\ K \\le k \\le N-1 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\right.\n$$\nremembering that $K = N - L + 1$. The weight $w_k$ simply reflects the number of times $\\tilde{f}_{i,k}$ and $\\tilde{f}_{j,k}$ appear in the Hankelised matrices $\\mathbf{\\tilde{X}}_i$ and $\\mathbf{\\tilde{X}}_j$, from which the time series $\\tilde{F}_i$ and $\\tilde{F}_j$ have been obtained.\n\nPut simply, if $(\\tilde{F}_i, \\tilde{F}_j)_w = 0$, $\\tilde{F}_i$ and $\\tilde{F}_j$ are *w-orthogonal* and the time series components are separable. Of course, total w-orthogonality does not occur in real life, so instead we define a $d \\times d$ ***weighted correlation*** matrix, $\\mathbf{W}_{\\text{corr}}$, which measures the deviation of the components $\\tilde{F}_i$ and $\\tilde{F}_j$ from w-orthogonality. The elements of $\\mathbf{W}_{\\text{corr}}$ are given by\n$$W_{i,j} = \\frac{(\\tilde{F}_i, \\tilde{F}_j)_w}{\\lVert \\tilde{F}_i \\rVert_w \\lVert \\tilde{F}_j \\rVert_w}$$\nwhere $\\lVert \\tilde{F}_k \\rVert_w = \\sqrt{(\\tilde{F}_k, \\tilde{F}_k)_w}$ for $k = i,j$. The interpretation of $W_{i,j}$ is straightforward: if $\\tilde{F}_i$ and $\\tilde{F}_j$ are arbitrarily close together (but not identical), then $(\\tilde{F}_i, \\tilde{F}_j)_w \\rightarrow \\lVert \\tilde{F}_i \\rVert_w \\lVert \\tilde{F}_j \\rVert_w$ and therefore $W_{i,j} \\rightarrow 1$. Of course, if $\\tilde{F}_i$ and $\\tilde{F}_j$ are w-orthogonal, then $W_{i,j} = 0$. Moderate values of $W_{i,j}$ between 0 and 1, say $W_{i,j} \\ge 0.3$, indicate components that may need to be grouped together.\n\nWithout further ado, let's construct the w-correlation matrix for the toy time series:"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"15cef5bd-e178-4204-b317-15d7f11b7cf7","_uuid":"acfda6d702610470e34e8df14659d2d2a6bebb17","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get the weights w first, as they'll be reused a lot.\n# Note: list(np.arange(L)+1) returns the sequence 1 to L (first line in definition of w), \n# [L]*(K-L-1) repeats L K-L-1 times (second line in w definition)\n# list(np.arange(L)+1)[::-1] reverses the first list (equivalent to the third line)\n# Add all the lists together and we have our array of weights.\nw = np.array(list(np.arange(L)+1) + [L]*(K-L-1) + list(np.arange(L)+1)[::-1])\n\n# Get all the components of the toy series, store them as columns in F_elem array.\nF_elem = np.array([X_to_TS(X_elem[i]) for i in range(d)])\n\n# Calculate the individual weighted norms, ||F_i||_w, first, then take inverse square-root so we don't have to later.\nF_wnorms = np.array([w.dot(F_elem[i]**2) for i in range(d)])\nF_wnorms = F_wnorms**-0.5\n\n# Calculate the w-corr matrix.

A Python Class for SSA<a name=\"Section4\"></a>\n\nSo far, the lines of code written to perform SSA on a time series have been spread through a number of cells, and are far outnumbered by the lines of code written to generate pretty plots. It is time to collect the SSA code into a handy class, imaginatively named *`SSA`*, which will form the basis for the rest of this notebook. Each instance of the class will contain the decomposition of a time series for some window length $L$, and provide useful methods to analyse, plot and reconstruct the time series.\n\nTo summarise the SSA algorithm:\n1. For a time series $F = (f_0, \\ f_1, \\ldots, \\ f_{N-1})$, and a window length $L$, form the trajectory matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, with columns given by the vectors $(f_i, \\ldots, f_{L+i-1})^{\\text{T}}$, $0 \\le i \\le N-L$.\n2. Decompose $\\mathbf{X}$ with the singular value decomposition, $\\mathbf{X} = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\\sigma_i U_i V^{\\text{T}}_i$.\n3. Construct the $d$ elementary matrices $\\mathbf{X}_i = \\sigma_i U_i V^{\\text{T}}_i$.\n4. Diagonally average the $\\mathbf{X}_i$ to form the elementary time series components $\\tilde{F}_i$, such that $F = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\tilde{F}_i$.\n5. Calculate and store the weighted correlation matrix, $\\mathbf{W}_{\\text{corr}}$, for the $\\tilde{F}_i$.\n\nThe task of grouping and classifying the elementary components $\\tilde{F}_i$ is left to the user."},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"1b8644a0-d5e9-47cd-8840-d8d0423c0852","_uuid":"fd31e71187c5d55ff333238d20343c788c1ad643","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"class SSA(object):\n    \n    __supported_types = (pd.Series, np.ndarray, list)\n    \n    def __init__(self, tseries, L, save_mem=True):\n        \"\"\"\n        Decomposes the given time series with a singular-spectrum analysis.

Let us suppose that everyone's walk has a unique 'signature' that can be extracted from accelerometer data. This signature could be compared across time series to determine whether the time series originates from the same person. Given the noise and complexity of the accelerometer time series, we therefore seek a way of extracting a simple, robust signature from the time series data.\n\nThe accelerometer time series we've seen so far contains a simple, regular low frequency component that can easily be extracted by SSA. The walking time series in the MotionSense dataset includes 24 different participants, walking on two separate occasions. We'll attempt to extract the 'signature' component from a handful of these series, and assess if it could act as an identifier for an individual. \n\n(This application of SSA has been inspired by the papers, [Persistent-homology-based gait recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06982.pdf) and, of course, the source of this dataset, [Protecting Sensory Data against Sensitive Inferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07802).) \n\n#### 6.4.1 Data Extraction and Processing<a name=\"Section6.4.1\"></a>\nBelow is a subroutine that will extract and return the accelerometer time series for a given subject.

Some Final Words<a name=\"Section7\"></a>\nThrough a relatively straightforward process of embedding, decomposition and reconstruction, the technique of **singular-spectrum analysis** can extract the trend of a time series, separate underlying periodicities and remove noise. It can be used as an exploratory tool, or in the context of a more detailed analysis. \n\nThis kernel has presented both the theory and implementation of singular-spectrum analysis, and applied it to a number of time series. Please feel free to use and extend the `SSA` Python class ([Section 4](#Section4)) in other Kaggle kernels and projects—just provide a note and link to this kernel as a source.\n\nThe version of singular-spectrum analysis presented here is typically termed *basic SSA*, as a number of variants and extensions to the method have been developed. Singular-spectrum analysis can also be used for forecasting, and detecting structural changes in a time series—that is, detecting where a time series has been perturbed and taken on a new 'behaviour'. Multivariate and 2D versions of singular-spectrum analysis also exist... unfortunately, this notebook is already too long as it is.\n\nIf you have read this far, I thank you for your persistence. I hope this kernel has done justice to this wonderful method of time series analysis."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
